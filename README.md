## CONTRIBUTING

### Branch Strategy

**ATTENTION:** There are 2 fixed branches within the version control system: the `main` & `dev` branches. These branches hold the source of truth for the state of the application. All topic branches are prefixed with the following prefixes:

- `feat/` for feature requests
- `fix/` for bug fixes
- `chore/` for enchancements such as dependency updates
- `test/` for PRs that only contain tests
- `doc/` for documentation

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the following command
   - `git checkout dev`
   - `git pull`
   - `git checkout -b <prefix>/<branch_name>` eg `git checkout -b feat/email_reminder_scheduling`

Try to keep the commits as granular and as compact as possible to avoid merge conflicts.
